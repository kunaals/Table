# Table
In high school, everyone is on a similar schedule. With the same class times and similar activity times, it is easy to sync up schedules with your friends to "hang out."
In college, however, things are very different. Everyone has different class times and different places to be so it's very hard to find time to meet with friends during the school week.
Introducing Table, an application that allows UW students to find times to connect with their friends over the course of the week. This pseudo-social network application will help students realize that their friends are only a table away.
